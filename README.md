8085 Microprocessor Emulator with Debugger

This repository contains a C++ program that serves as an emulator for the 8085 microprocessor. The emulator allows users to input 8085 assembly code either through the console or by loading a previously saved program. It includes a debugger feature that can be toggled on or off, providing users with the ability to step through the program or run it without debugging.

Key Features:
- Console-based input for 8085 assembly code.
- Option to load and continue from a previously saved program.
- Integrated debugger with options to toggle debugging on or off.
- Emulation of 8085 instructions and memory handling.

Usage:
1. Run the program and choose between using the emulator or exiting.
2. If using the emulator, input the starting address and 8085 assembly code.
3. Optionally enable the debugger to step through the code.
4. View and analyze the execution of the 8085 program.
